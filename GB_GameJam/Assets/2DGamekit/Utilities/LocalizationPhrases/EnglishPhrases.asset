  - key: INFOPOST1
    value: "\u201CHello? Is anyone else here? Better keep moving or I\u2019ll be
      talking to myself for the whole trip. Let\u2019s use A and D for left and right,
      SPACE to jump and err\u2026 how about S to crouch?\u201D"
  - key: INFOPOST2
    value: "\u201CWeird, it feels spongy and strange underfoot. What happens if we
      try S and SPACE at the same time?\u201D "
  - key: INFOPOST3
    value: "\u201CThis place just got interesting! Use K to hit and O to shoot. Let\u2019s
      try it on this innocent looking wall.\u201D"
  - key: JetpackFound
    value: "\u201CCool! A jetpack! By using it, I can get almost anywhere. Seems
      low on power, though. Probably not powerful enough to let me go upward. Let's
      try to hold the SPACE while jumping and move in the air with S, A, or D\u201D"
  - key: JetpackExaust1
    value: "\u201CLooks like this guy couldn't find a way out of here. Maybe I can
      blast through those rocks with jetpack jet stream\u201D"
  - key: JetpackExaust2
    value: "\u201CThose guys look dangerous. Maybe I can use the jet stream to defend
      myself.\u201D"
  - key: JetpackUpgrade
    value: "\u201COh, how lucky I am! This battery will strengthen my backpack, I
      will be able to fly higher. Just press W while flying.\u201D"
